# README for Michael Botes
Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Michael Botes(He/Him) but everyone I know has taken to calling me Boats â›µ. 
I am a INTJ and a Red/Yellow type of personality person, what this means is I'm a highly self motivated person that loves getting things done as they arrive, and genuinely have fun with getting everyone else involved in the process.

## Who am I?
### Non-work
I currently Live in Johannesburg, South Africa, but soon will be moving back to my home city of Cape Town.
My hobbies include playing World of Warcraft (EU-Dunemaul, Horde!!), Reading fantasy books and playing jazz/blues guitar.

### Work
I am a bit of a curious badger, I started out as a front-end developer and found myself being fascinated by just about every aspect of web development, so I would find myself scratching and digging relentlessly at things until I slowly figured it out, this has led to me having a pretty broad comfort zone but not really having profoundly deep knowledge in a particular field, I definitely have a stronger side routed in Front end engineering and have a big fascination for cloud technology, and thus have quite a bit of skills in Google Cloud & Kubernetes but at the same time can get my hands dirty in Azure Devops for example. 

Long story short is that give me a task and I will figure it out and if I get stuck then I can get it to the right people to help me finish it and learn along the way.

## Goals
### Learning goals
What do you want to learn? For example â€” if you are a software developer and want to
learn more about a particular area in software, like performance or security, let your
team know that. This could help your project lead assign you tasks that fit your goals.
