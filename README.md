#  Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Michael Botes(He/Him) but everyone calls me Boats â›µ. 
I am an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and [Red/Yellow](https://www.glurecruit.co.uk/red-blue-green-yellow-personality-type/) personality type, what this means is I'm a highly self-motivated person that loves getting things done as they arrive and genuinely have fun with getting everyone else involved in the process.

## Who am I?
### Non-work
I currently Live in Cape-Town, South Africa, after having lived in Johannesburg for the last 3 years, with my wife and three cat children.
My hobbies include gaming, used to raid World of Warcraft on Sunday and Monday nights, Reading fantasy books, and playing jazz/blues guitar.

### Work
I am a bit of a curious badger, I started out as a front-end developer and found myself being fascinated by just about every aspect of web development, so I would end up scratching and digging relentlessly at things until I slowly figured it out, this has led to me having a pretty broad comfort zone but not really having profoundly deep knowledge in a particular field, I definitely have a higher proficiency in Front-end engineering and have a big fascination for cloud technology, and thus have quite a bit of skill in Google Cloud & Kubernetes but at the same time can get my hands dirty in Azure DevOps for example. 

Long story short is that give me a task and I will figure it out and if I get stuck, I can find the right people to help me finish it and learn along the way.

## Goals
### Learning goals
after spending a lot of time jumping around with different technologies and stacks, now I would like to spend some time deepening my knowledge base and skills in Front-end engineering with a strong foot in the Cloud, thus the following technologies are what I am focusing on:
- React/React Native
- Vue
- Google Cloud
- Azure/AWS - still deciding which one to do next, might get certified in all three
- Python

### Career goals
I would love to see myself one day as a Frontend engineering team leader and be responsible for my colleagues and our goals.
This would even include meeting clients to get requirements and making sure my team can run with them from start to finish and all the technical implementations that go with it.

## You can lean on me to â€¦
I'm usually quite a bulldog on getting things done, so count on me on getting a task over the line or to drop what I'm doing if emergencies arise and are taken care of properly. I'm never averse to getting my hands dirty and jumping into the thick of things.
